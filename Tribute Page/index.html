        <h1>Who was George Carlin?</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Born and raised by his mother in Manhattan, New York City. His parents divorced when he was two months. His mother
          (as well as his father) worked in marketing, where they met. The long hours the mother worked left the young George
          by himself for long hours every day, providing him (in his own words), the time he needed to think about various
          subjects, listen to radio, and practice his impersonations, that where acclaimed by his mother and coworkers since
          an early age. Carlin started out as a conventional comedian and had achieved a fair degree of success as a Bill
          Cosby style raconteur in nightclubs and on TV until the late 1960s, when he radically overhauled his persona. His
          routines became more insightful, introducing more serious subjects. As he aged, he became more cynic and bitter,
          unintentionally changing his stage persona again in a radical way throughout the 90s. This new George Carlin, usually
          referred to as the late George Carlin, is one of the most acclaimed and enjoyed by the public and critics. Carlin's
          forte is Lenny Bruce-style social and political commentary, spiced with nihilistic observations about people and
          religion peppered with black humor. He is also noted for his masterful knowledge and use of the English language.
          Carlin's notorious "Seven Dirty Words" comedy routine was part of a radio censorship case that made its way to
          the U.S. Supreme Court in 1978.</p>
